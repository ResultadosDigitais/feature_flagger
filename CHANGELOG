## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2020-06-15
### Added
- A new structure of data inside Storage::Redis #60
- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a
  standardized open-source project CHANGELOG.
- New `Model#releases` method, which will return all the features accessible by the `Model`

### Breaking Changes
- The main API of `FeatureFlagger::Control` and `FeatureFlagger::Storage`
  got rewritten, we decoupled the `resource_name` from the `feature_key`
  and that allowed us to change the way we store the data
