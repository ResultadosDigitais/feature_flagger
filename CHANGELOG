## [UNRELEASED]
- Add integration with ActionSupport::Cache's stores. As rollouts don't change often, adding a cache can save thousands of calls to the storage. It's possible to configure the same way Rails allows cache_stores to be configured.

  configuration.cache_store = :memory_store, { expires_in: 100 }

  Additionally, we also added an option to skip the cache entirely by adding a `skip_cache: true` on FF methods. Example:

  Account.released_id?(resource_id, key, skip_local_cache: true)

  By default there is no cache configured.


## [2.0.1] - 2021-01-27

## [2.0.0] - 2020-06-15

* This version has some issues with Redis Keys. Use version 2.0.1 or 1.2.1.*

### Added
- A new structure of data inside Storage::Redis #60
- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a
  standardized open-source project CHANGELOG.
- New `Model#releases` method, which will return all the features accessible by the `Model`

### Breaking Changes
- The main API of `FeatureFlagger::Control` and `FeatureFlagger::Storage`
  got rewritten, we decoupled the `resource_name` from the `feature_key`
  and that allowed us to change the way we store the data

- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as an evolving example of a
  standardized open-source project CHANGELOG.

### Breaking Changes
- The main API of `FeatureFlagger::Storage` and `FeatureFlagger::Storage::Redis` got rewritten,

  way we store the data to implement new features.
